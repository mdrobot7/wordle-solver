How Wordle Works:
Solution word - folly

Guess 1 - flowy
- The f and y would be green, because they are the right letters in the right place
- The l and o would be yellow, because they are the right letters in the wrong place
- The w would be gray, it is not in the solution word at all

Guess 2 - knoll
- The o and first l would be green, because they are in the solution and in the right place
- The second l would be yellow, because it is also in the solution word but in the wrong place
- The k and n would be gray

New word - locks

Guess 1 - flowy
- No letters are green.
- The l and o are yellow, because they are in the wrong place
- The f, w, and y are gray.

Guess 2 - knoll
- No letters are green
- The k, o, and first l are yellow, because they are in the wrong place
- the n and second l are gray -- the n is not in the word, and there is only one l (the 'yellow' was taken by the first one)
